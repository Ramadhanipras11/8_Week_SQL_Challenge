## Business Task
Danny started by recruiting ‚Äúrunners‚Äù to deliver fresh pizza from Pizza Runner Headquarters (otherwise known as Danny‚Äôs house) and also maxed out his credit card to pay freelance developers to build a mobile app to accept orders from customers. Because Danny had a few years of experience as a data scientist - he was very aware that data collection was going to be critical for his business‚Äô growth.

## üöø Data Cleaning and Transformation
#### üìÉ Table : customer_orders
in the `customer_orders` table, we can see there are
- in the `exclusion` columns, there are missing/blank spaces such as  ' '  and null values
- in the `extras` column, there are missing/blank spaces such as  ' '  and null values
<img width="539" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2f2677a5-03c4-40ad-bbe6-e884f184573a" /> 

our course of action to clean the table :
- Create a temporary table with all the columns
- Remove null values in `exlusions` and `extras` columns and replace with blank space ' '.
````sql
CREATE TABLE customer_orders_temporary AS
SELECT order_id,
	   customer_id,
       pizza_id,
	CASE WHEN exclusions IS NULL OR exclusions LIKE 'null' THEN ''
		ELSE exclusions END AS exclusions,
    CASE WHEN extras IS NULL OR extras LIKE 'null' THEN ''
		ELSE extras END AS extras,
	  order_time
FROM customer_orders;
````
This is how the customer_orders_temporary table looks like after being cleaned and we can use this for query processing.

#### üìÉ Table : runner_orders
in the `runner_orders` table, we can see there are
- in the `pickup_time` columns, there are null values
- in the `distance` column, there are null values
- in the `duration` column, there are null values
- in the `cancellation` column, there are missing values and null values

our course of action to clean the table
- create a temporary table with all the column
- remove null values in `pickup_time`, `distance`, `duration`, and `cancellation`. And replace with blank space
- remove 'km' in `distance` columns
- remove 'mins', 'minute', 'minutes' in `duration` columns
````sql
